    <description><![CDATA[Si vous êtes comme moi et que vous vous intéressez un petit peu à l&rsquo;IA, vous avez probablement entendu parler d&rsquo;IA super-puissantes, notamment GPT-3 ou DALL-E 2.
Pour ceux qui ne savent pas de quoi il s&rsquo;agit, je vais faire une rapide présentation de ce que sont ces deux modèles d&rsquo;intelligence artificielle, et de ce dont ils sont capables.
OpenAI, une des entreprises majeures en IA, a récemment sorti deux modèles à couper le souffle nommés GPT-3 et DALL-E 2, respectivement les successeurs de GPT-2 et DALL-E.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I worked as an intern for the Direction du Numérique of the Université de Bourgogne for 10 weeks. It was the perfect oportunity for me to work on a real project and to learn more about what is research, but also to learn more about AI, and especially NLP.
The first project I was asked to create a new dataset about tourism to upgrade the idiomaticity of an animated conversational agent that will be used in the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[What is that ? I had the chance to work on a real project during my studies. It was about the analysis of CT images of pelvic fractures.
I worked one afternoon per week during one semester in the TIMC laboratory in the GMCAO team.
Abstract Acetabular fracture (cavity in the pelvis where the head of the femur is located), generally require a CT scan to locate and classify the fractures according to their type, according to the Letournel classification.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The project The project was done in a team of 5 people. The goal was to deliver an Android App together with a test benchmark, a complete documentation and a functionnal backend.
More about the project The App should allow users to create stories and share them with others. The idea is that after each paragraph, an action can be taken and then, it leads to a new paragraph. Everyone can create new paragraphs, read stories etc&hellip; depending on the permissions they have.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Introduction As a member of Ens&rsquo;IA, I give lectures and lab works about artificial intelligence.
In 2021/2022, @Hugo Cartigny and I gave lectures and lab works about
Machine Learning with KNN and K-Means Deep learning in computer vision (perceptron, sigmoid neuron, neural networks, convolutional neural nerworks &hellip;) Data processing for computer vision As you can see, we did not talk about Reinforcement Learning yet, so I dicided to build a course about it, especially about Q-Learning]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The game Blobwar is played on an 8x8 chessboard where two players (blue and red) compete. Each player has a set of pieces called blobs. The game is played turn by turn. Each turn, whenever possible, the current player chooses a blob and moves it. Any move to an adjacent square (including diagonally) sees the blob duplicated on the target square. It is also possible to jump to a distance of 2 squares, but in this case the blob moves from the starting square to the target square (so there is no duplication).]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[What is the project about ? The goal is to build in Java a compiler with no default for a language called Deca (Java like language)
The compilation process is divided into 3 steps :
The syntax analysis (Lexer and Parser) input : source program output : primitive abstract tree The contextual verification input : primitive abstract tree output : abstract tree decorated The code generation for an abstract machine input : abstract tree decorated output : assembly program Finally, the project is also composed of a theme of our choice.]]></description>
