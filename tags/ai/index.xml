    <description><![CDATA[I worked as an intern for the Direction du Num√©rique of the Universit√© de Bourgogne for 10 weeks. It was the perfect oportunity for me to work on a real project and to learn more about what is research, but also to learn more about AI, and especially NLP.
The first project I was asked to create a new dataset about tourism to upgrade the idiomaticity of an animated conversational agent that will be used in the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[What is that ? I had the chance to work on a real project during my studies. It was about the analysis of CT images of pelvic fractures.
I worked one afternoon per week during one semester in the TIMC laboratory in the GMCAO team.
Abstract Acetabular fracture (cavity in the pelvis where the head of the femur is located), generally require a CT scan to locate and classify the fractures according to their type, according to the Letournel classification.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Introduction As a member of Ens&rsquo;IA, I give lectures and lab works about artificial intelligence.
In 2021/2022, @Hugo Cartigny and I gave lectures and lab works about
Machine Learning with KNN and K-Means Deep learning in computer vision (perceptron, sigmoid neuron, neural networks, convolutional neural nerworks &hellip;) Data processing for computer vision As you can see, we did not talk about Reinforcement Learning yet, so I dicided to build a course about it, especially about Q-Learning]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The game Blobwar is played on an 8x8 chessboard where two players (blue and red) compete. Each player has a set of pieces called blobs. The game is played turn by turn. Each turn, whenever possible, the current player chooses a blob and moves it. Any move to an adjacent square (including diagonally) sees the blob duplicated on the target square. It is also possible to jump to a distance of 2 squares, but in this case the blob moves from the starting square to the target square (so there is no duplication).]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Introduction I organized this challenge with Hugo Cartigny and Neovision. We worked hard on this edition for almost an entire year.
There was approximately 50 participants for this edition.
Below is the official description of the challenge.
What is this challenge about? This is an artificial intelligence challenge organized jointly by Neovision and Ens&rsquo;IA. For the second edition of this challenge, participants had to create an AI, but don&rsquo;t panic: Neovision coaches will were there to accompany them.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[VirtualDragAndDrop I was kind of bored a week end so I wanted to do something that will be absolutely never used again üôÉ.
This little project allowed me to get in touch with OpenCV and image processing.
The program I built creates a virtual drag and drop on objects represented by their centers. I used rectangle for this example.
To use the program, just run the file main.py. Then to move an object, you have to &ldquo;grab it&rdquo; = close your hand when your hand is on the object.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The challenge: This challenge was organized by Ens&rsquo;IA and Neovision in 2021. It lasted a month and a half and was about the well known subject of Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
What is OCR ? It&rsquo;s about converting images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text. Learn more ‚û°Ô∏è The goal was quite simple but still very challenging:
building the best model to recognize the characters in the dataset given by Neovision.]]></description>
