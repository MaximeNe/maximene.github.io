    <description><![CDATA[The game Blobwar is played on an 8x8 chessboard where two players (blue and red) compete. Each player has a set of pieces called blobs. The game is played turn by turn. Each turn, whenever possible, the current player chooses a blob and moves it. Any move to an adjacent square (including diagonally) sees the blob duplicated on the target square. It is also possible to jump to a distance of 2 squares, but in this case the blob moves from the starting square to the target square (so there is no duplication).]]></description>
