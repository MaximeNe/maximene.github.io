    <description><![CDATA[Summary of the Log Analysis Application Development Project This project is focused on developing an internal application for log analysis using Machine Learning (ML).
Context and Motivation With the exponential growth of digital services, log analysis has become an increasingly important area of study. Logs are generated in massive quantities by various systems, making manual analysis infeasible. Automated tools are necessary to manage these logs effectively. The goal of the project was to develop an internal solution capable of analyzing logs to monitor the state of SOLUTEC’s IT systems and detect anomalies in internal systems under development.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I worked as an intern for the Direction du Numérique of the Université de Bourgogne for 10 weeks. It was the perfect oportunity for me to work on a real project and to learn more about what is research, but also to learn more about AI, and especially NLP.
The first project I was asked to create a new dataset about tourism to upgrade the idiomaticity of an animated conversational agent that will be used in the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[What is that ? I had the chance to work on a real project during my studies. It was about the analysis of CT images of pelvic fractures.
I worked one afternoon per week during one semester in the TIMC laboratory in the GMCAO team.
Abstract Acetabular fracture (cavity in the pelvis where the head of the femur is located), generally require a CT scan to locate and classify the fractures according to their type, according to the Letournel classification.]]></description>
